# multiplA.R.
Shared augmented reality application with live user tracking and synchronization in real space, making multiplayer AR feasible

This is a side project in Apple's ARKit involving the synchronization of several devices in the same augmented reality state. 
As of right now, there is no concrete accurate way to track phones in a synchronized AR environment besides holding them side to side or using printed out QR codes, and even then, the phones cannot be tracked live. This project tackles both of those issues
We demonstrated this technology through a simple painting app, which uses our synchronization process to track the other phone's current position and paintings. Setup takes mere moments, and tracking is accurate and precise.

Shortly after this project was completed (1 week!), google released their cloud anchor system as their solution to the multiplayer problem, however setup times and accuracy between their method and this one is comparable.

Here is a demo video of the current version of multiplA.R.
